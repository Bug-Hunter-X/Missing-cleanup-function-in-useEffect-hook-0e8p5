# Missing Cleanup Function in useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications: a missing cleanup function in the `useEffect` hook.  This can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The `useEffect` hook in the `MyComponent` component is missing the return statement of the cleanup function causing memory leaks or unexpected behavior if the component unmounts. This happens because any functions registered in the `useEffect` hook won't be removed, causing potential issues for your application. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding a return statement to the `useEffect` hook to properly define the cleanup function which helps in cleaning up any subscriptions, timers, or other resources when the component is unmounted. This ensures that the component properly cleans up after itself, preventing unexpected behavior and memory leaks.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
